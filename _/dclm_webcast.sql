Out of this amount, he owed his clients a total of about ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND GHANA CEDIS (Ghc 130,000.00), which he decided to pay after his LAPAROTOMY.\r\n\r\nThe bank informed him that they had gone through serious \"panic withdrawals\". Hence, no money was \"available\" to pay him for him to in turn settle his clients. However, they assured him, sooner than later he will receive his money (close to a year now).\r\n\r\nFortunately or unfortunately, he passed on to glory without receiving his money from the bank till now (at the time of writing, June 21, 2019). The clients keep calling us (children and wife) asking us of their money. It is the grace of God that has kept us till now that we haven\'t been \"sued\" or \"pressured\" or \"burdened\" to the extreme yet.\r\n\r\nWe want believers to help us in prayer that the Lord should let the bank release the funds to us so that we can pay the clients and have our peace of mind.
